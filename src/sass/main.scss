/**
 * This is the main application stylesheet.
 * To avoid inheritance issues Sass is organized by file types:
 * - functions: methods to shortcut some Sass assets (ex: get some specific color from the $color_list map)
 * - mixins: code assets
 * - shared-components: helpers developed to not redo the Wheel
 * - app-files: get the Sass from each view/section developed
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Make sure all the `*.scss` files have underscore to partial them (otherwise Sass will create a CSS file for each without)
